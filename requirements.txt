(this is our empty requirements file, where we can add all the necessary packages and libraries needed for our project! ðŸ“¦)

Requirements.txt allows you to declare, share, track, install and recreate Python dependencies for your projects in a simple text file.
This is a best practice for managing dependencies in Python.

The file goes in the root of your repository and is updated manually or with pip freeze.
It is then used during pip install for easy dependency management.
