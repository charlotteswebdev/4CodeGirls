What is the purpose of a .gitignore file?

A .gitignore file is used to tell Git which files or folders to ignore when committing code to a Git repository.

Typical uses:

Build artifacts (bin, out)
Logs, caches, temp files
Dependency folders (node_modules)
Editor metadata (.idea)
OS-generated files (.DS_Store)
Secrets and credentials (.env)

Listing ignore patterns in .gitignore keeps repositories lean by avoiding large binary assets, temporary files, and unnecessary folders.
It integrates with Git commands like git add.

To summarize, .gitignore optimizes Git repos by ignoring non-source files from version control.
